# PiReportServices

This service can be used as a Telegram bot to retrieve information about next buses arriving at Santander bus stops. It also automatically reports (with Twitter integration) on server status updates or changes

Eventually, a managing interface will be implemented..

It works as a Maven project, which can be constructed and deployed in a web container like Apache (tested) or JBoss (untested). 

This is an experimental project to learn more on Spring application configuration, integration between services, and social network APIs.
