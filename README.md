Service to automatically report (with Twitter integration)  on a server status updates or changes, and eventually manage it through REST.

It works as a Maven project, which can be constructed and deployed in a web container like Apache (tested) or JBoss (untested). 

This is an experimental project to learn more on Spring application configuration, integration between services, and social network APIs.
